        <h3>About Fitness center in 2014</h3>
        <p>This website serves around 300,000 page views each month and most of the traffic comes from the US, UK, Australia, Japan, and Germany. Our themes are downloaded over 200,000 in less than one year and hopefully, we can double this number by end of 2014 (hopefully we will remember to update this number when the time comes).</p>
        <h3>About Fitness center in 2015</h3>
        <p>Today I noticed that this section needs a massive update to include how well we did in 2014. We closed 2014 with 450,000 visitors on average and a whooping 900,000 page views a month. Our themes have been downloaded over 600,000 times. We have come a long way and there is no sign of slowing down and we think we have just started our journey.
            
        We want to contribute to the WordPress community by releasing free WordPress themes, but you can expect premium features and themes.
            
        This project is entirely run by one person, but currently, Colorlib is seeking someone who could make this website even more useful for the WordPress community.</p>
        <h3>About Fitness Center in 2020</h3>
        <p>This year we started selling our own website templates. We already have over 1,000 Bootstrap templates and add a new one daily. We offer them as part of a subscription with support and regular updates. This year marks when we switched from purely affiliate income and jumped into our product development. Full control over the user experience allows for delivering the best products and services.

        We know that this isn’t the best About Us page ever but we have some recommendations for ones that are.</p>
