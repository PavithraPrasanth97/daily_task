    Sebamed Baby, the name familiar in the Baby Products market and most of the parents are aware of this brand. There are hardly any advertisements we can see on TV for Sebamed Baby Products. But still the brand is hugely popular among the parents, especially the new parents. I and my wife, Manasi, are also one of those parents.

    I‚Äôm not writing this as part of any campaign from Sebamed or haven‚Äôt received any FREE products from Sebamed for a review. I‚Äôm doing this post to share my experience after using Sebamed products for my Little Princess Oishi for almost 3 years now. We started using Sebamed Baby Products right after Oishi was born in beginning of 2019. It was a gift hamper from the hospital and after using the sample products in the hamper there was no switching to any other baby products.</pre>
